# DEX

The goal of this project is to build an imaginary DEX (a super simplistic version of Uniswap V1) with one trading pair of tokens: ETH and our own imaginary Crypto Devs (CD) token ðŸ™ƒ

## More detailed features include:

- Build an exchange with one asset pair (Eth / Crypto Dev)
- The Decentralized Exchange should take a fees of 1% on swaps
- When user adds liquidity, they should be given Crypto Dev LP tokens (Liquidity Provider tokens)
- CD LP tokens should be given proportional to the Ether user is willing to add to the liquidity
